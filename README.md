Hi! My name is Tianhao Yao. I am a 3rd year computer science undergraduate student (with a minor in statistics) at the University of Waterloo and currently enrolled in the Co-operative Education program. I am having a 3.91/4.00 CGPA and I’ve been on the Dean’s Honour List for 3 terms thus far.

Some topics that I’ve already studied in school include functional programming, OOP, computer organization and architecture, computational statistics, data structures and data management, algorithms, operating systems, and programming language principles (theory, design, and implementation of compilers and interpreters).

I was previously a software development intern for two terms (Sep. ~ Dec. ‘19, May ~ Aug. ‘20) at Ford Motor Company of Canada, where I worked on the voice infotainment assistant on connected vehicles. I am now about to complete my 3rd internship (Jan. ~ Apr. ‘21), during which I’ve been working as a full-stack software engineering intern at TELUS on the data warehouse services team.

During my personal time, I enjoy creating software engineering projects on my own. My go-to languages and technologies are (Node.js + Express) or (Python + Flask), Angular or ejs, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and sometimes Socket.io for web-development; AndroidStudio, Java, and XML for building android apps; and C++ and Python with different libraries, APIs and/or SDKs for many other miscellaneous programs.

I’ve had the chance to participate in MLH official collegiate hackathons two times, during which I worked solo on “Crypto Club” and “B-Day Surprises”. The latter project submission was awarded “Best Use of Linode” at SurpriseHacks in March 2021. Should you be interested, please visit my Devpost portfolio to view more details about my hackathon submissions and/or my Github page to check out the source code of theirs along with that of other projects’.

Since high school I’ve participated in a number of mathematics and programming competitions, both at the national and international level. Most recently I attended Google Kickstart 2021 Round A, at which I (username: tianhaoy) was placed among the top 5.23% of all contestants worldwide and ranked 19th in Canada. Prior to that, I achieved First Prize at National Olympiad in Informatics in provinces upper division (NOIP), Distinguished Honour Roll at American Mathematics Contest (AMC 10&12), and Finalist at Intl. Math Modeling Challenge (IM2C) co-hosted by COMAP.
